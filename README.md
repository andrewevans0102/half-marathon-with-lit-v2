# Half Marathon With Lit V2

This is an open source version of a half marathon training application. I also uses this application as an example in my blog post [Getting Started with Lit]().

The application is built with the [Lit Framework](https://lit.dev/).

There are components that show the month, week, total, and a countdown to race day.

The application uses Vite and can be ran locally with `npm run dev`.

The application showcases some basic functionality of Lit, but I recommend checking out the [official documentation](https://lit.dev/docs/) for more information.
