2. **Listen to Your Body**: If you feel pain or extreme fatigue, it's okay to take an extra rest day or adjust your mileage.
3. **Hydrate and Fuel**: Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet to fuel your runs.
4. **Cross-Training**: On rest days, consider light cross-training like cycling, swimming, or yoga to maintain overall fitness.
5. **Gradual Progression**: Follow the plan progressively, increasing mileage gradually to avoid injuries.
6. **Race Preparation**: The week before the race, focus on rest, hydration, and nutrition. Avoid any strenuous activities.

This plan ensures you gradually build up your endurance and mileage while respecting your schedule preferences. Good luck with your training!
